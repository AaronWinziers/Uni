\chapter{Introduction}
\section{3 Big Vs}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Volume
	\item Velocity - Data should be updated much more quickly - no longer work in batches
	\item Variety - Videos, text, from web etc
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Veracity} joins the other 3 Vs nowadays

\section{Volume}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Average company has 100 TB of data
	\item 2.5 quintillion bytes created every day
	\item the amount of data created will be 300x greater in 2020 than 2005 (aggregate, estimate)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenges created by data volume}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Efficient storage
	\item Efficiant process queries
	\item Efficient learning with models
	\item What hardware and software architecture is needed for this?
\end{itemize}


\section{Variety}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Data consists of different forms of data
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenges created by data variety}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Syntactic heterogeneity - understadning different data types and formats
	\item Semantic heterogeneity - Differnt representations forthe same information
		\subitem Name abreviations - John Smith, J Smith, (Smith, John), Jon Smithe
	\item The prev 2 issues need to be understood because we need to combine:
		\subitem information from many different sources
		\subitem different types of information
\end{itemize}


\section{Velocity}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The speed at which data is created and processed
	\item Data needs to be processed quickly or otherwise (sometimes) forgotten
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenges created by data velocity}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Extremely fast flow of information
	\item Assessing the value of incoming information and drop "unimportant" information
	\item Quick integration of new information
\end{itemize}


\section{Veracity}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Deals with the uncertainty of data
	\item Can you trust the data?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenges created by data velocity}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Differnet kinds of data defects:
		\subitem Data may be invalid (broken sensors, bad software)
		\subitem Data may be biased and not reflect the true population
		\subitem Data may be manipulated
	\item Methods are needed to identify and "repair" data defects
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User-Generated Data}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Users may answer dishonestly or not take surveys seriously
	\item Users may try to purposely influence the results of surveys
	\item Must check the plausibility of the data before using	
\end{itemize}
